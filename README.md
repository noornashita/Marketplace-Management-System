# Marketplace-Management-System

Introduction:


Objectives: 
• To design and implement a secure and scalable platform for buying and selling second hand items.  
• To ensure trust through profile verification, item quality control, and mutual feedback.  
• To provide dynamic negotiation and order management between verified buyers and sellers.  

Functionalities: 
The Second-Hand Marketplace Management System is an online platform for buying and selling used items such as books, electronics, clothing, and furniture. It includes buyer and seller registration with profile verification. Sellers can list and manage their products under specific categories, providing detailed information and images. The system manages orders, tracks item status (available, reserved, sold), and supports both delivery and scheduled in-person meetups. An admin panel oversees user verification, product moderation, and reports, ensuring quality control and a safe trading environment.
